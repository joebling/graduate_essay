Abstact:
This paper, as the sequel to previous work, develops numerical schemes for fractional diffusion equations on a two-dimensional 
finite domain with triangular meshes. We adopt the nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods for the full spatial discretization by
the use of high-order nodal basis, employing multivariate Lagrange polynomials defined on the triangles. Stability analysis 
and error estimates are provided, which shows that if polynomials of degree N are used, the methods are (N+1)-th order 
accurate for general triangulations. Finally, the performed numerical experiments confirm the optimal order of convergence.
